# Bitcoin's Never Look Back Price

This is a simple little page to track Bitcoin's "Never Look Back" price, as
described in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@cane.island/why-bitcoin-is-never-looking-back-f06ab333742e).

### Current Limitations

- The data must be manually updated, so is not always fresh.

### Todo

- Figure out what's going on with `constants.js`
- Sliders
- Implement [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build)

### Tech Choices

This project is an experiment in using vanilla, *browser-side* Javascript
modules. Avoiding transpiling is a goal, nice as React and Mobx are.
